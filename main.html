			<h2 class="blue couriernew center">What is Headspace?</h2>
			<p class="center" style="padding-right:10%; padding-left:10%;">The Headspace App is an online guided meditation app filled with simple but beautiful graphics. Its purpose is to make meditation and mental health practices more convenient and accessible. <br><br> The app is free to download, but it has a subscription-based business model with a basic and a premium package. The basic subscription gives users a limited amount of all the features (ie. a few sessions of each feature of meditation course, sleepcast, etc.). The premium subscription is $13 per month (or $70 a year) and unlocks all the features including live meditation (see below). </p>

			<h1>3. Personalized Experience</h1>
			<p>While Headspace offers a collection of diverse Meditation and Sleep features, the app does not fail to create a sense of personalization for the user. The app is designed to highlight the user's personal journey; <span class="blue bold">the app focuses on the user and his or her self-development</span>. Thus, features such as adding buddies and visual representations of progress enhance this feeling of personal achievement, in turn creating motivation for a healthy body and mind.</p>

			<h3 class="center" style="padding-left:15%; padding-right:15%; padding-top:15%;padding-bottom:5%;">After going through all these in-app product features, there are a few specific qualities, some of which have already been mentioned, that I love and other users keep coming back for include.</h3>
			<h1 class="center">First, who are the users and what are there pain points?</h1>
			<section style="padding-left:10%; padding-right:10%;padding-bottom: 10%;">
				<p>Headspace's users include anyone who is busy, subject to a lot of anxiety, going through a life change, etc. <br><br>The first user that comes to mind are <span class="bold blue">students</span>, college students especially. Most college students are living away from home and are learning to independently balance studying, working, socializing, and so much more. They are subject to a lot of pressure and stress, and oftentimes neglect their mental health. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, <span class="bold blue">50% of students rate their mental health below average or poor </span>with 40% of students failing to seek help. <br><br>Another user group would be <span class="bold blue">working parents</span> or even businesspeople in general. With working parents, especially mothers or new parents, balancing work and life becomes incredibly difficult. Lack of sleep is another huge problem with anxious people who are always thinking about their to-do lists. There is little, if any, personal time, and stress is always a constant.<br><br>So, <span class="bold blue">young busy people</span> who are <span class="bold blue">constantly moving</span> and/or stressed are the main target consumers. But, with that being said, Headspace is an app that is applicabl to anyone because mental health and good sleep are important for every single person, regardless of age, gender, race, background.
				An easy and convenient app like Headspace works to promote mental health in a way that they can control and slowly integrate into their lives. <span class="orange">Now, let's discuss what features address these pain points...</span></p>
			</section>
			<section class="flexcenter">
				<img class="img" style="width:80%; padding-right:3%; padding-bottom: 10%;" src="\Users\maggiepan\Desktop\ff_pm_challenge\coolheadspace.png">
			</section>
			<section class="flexcol">
				<h3 class="orange">1. Convenience</h3>
				<p style="padding-right:20%;">Because it is a phone app available on both Android and iOS, Headspace is extremely accessible in any location and time at a tap of the finger. Because <span class="bold blue">it is designed for busy people</span>, the app allows the user to decide how long their meditation session should be, ranging from 3 to 10 minutes (see Meditation section above). This feature allows users to complete a session in between meetings, after lunch; it <span class="bold blue">eliminates the inconvenience and time wasted</span> from travelling to a physical meditation studio to relax and meditate. Scheduling and finding time to squeeze in these things will no longer be a stress point either. Headspace makes mental health practices available <span class="bold blue">anytime and anywhere.</span></p>
				<h3 class="right orange">2. End-to-End Visual Experience</h3>
				<p class="right" style="padding-left:20%;">From the moment the user taps onto the app on their phone to during their meditation session to exiting the app, the beautiful graphics create a calming end-to-end experience. Upon opening the app, the <span class="bold blue">muted and soft color scheme</span> (similar to that of this website) create a neutral and calming feeling. There are no bright or clashing colors; everything works and blends together nicely. Additionally, the <span class="bold blue">animations and graphics</span> of various landscapes and creatures are all curved and bubbly, without sharp edges that could subconsciously create feelings of anxiety or stress. Seen throughout the app, the <span class="bold blue">slow, smooth, and fluid transitions</span> in these graphics and animations give users a beautiful and satisfying end-to-end experience. Moreover, there are no cluttered graphics, pop-ups, or ads that disrupt the user's navigation throughout the app. This <span class="bold blue">complete minimalistic aesthetic</span> that <span class="bold blue">enhances the UX</span> is unique to Headspace.</p>
				<h3 class="orange">3. Diversity</h3>
				<p style="padding-right:20%;">The diversity of options and meditation topics, and courses allow users to have a <span class="bold blue">different and interesting experience each time</span> they use the app. According to a Forbes article, 74% of Americans, and millennials in particular, <span class="bold blue">value experiences over material products</span>. So, the broad and diverse options and customizations target these users, encouraging them to return to the app. Moreover, the wide range of topics caters to many interests. Users learn something new and <span class="bold blue">feel productive while relaxing</span> through these different educational courses. This diversity of experiences is something I really love about the app.</p>
				<h3 class="right orange">4. Personalization</h3>
				<p class="right" style="padding-left:20%;">The personalization aspect of the app allows users to <span class="bold blue">feel in control and adapt the app to their daily needs</span>. Users can decide what notifications they receive (ie. reminders to meditate, reminders to sleep, mindfulness tips, etc.) and when they receive it. The customized Siri phrases also allows users to design how they want to use the app. In addition, the clean and minimalistic visualization of the user's journey and stats really show users their progress and <span class="bold blue">makes them feel good</span> about themselves, encouraging to continue to use the app and practice good mental health. (See above personalization features for more details) These personalization features make the app <span class="bold blue">easily integrable into every user's unique lifestyles and habits</span>, adding on to the convenience aspect mentioned earlier.</p>
