			<h2 class="blue couriernew center">What is Headspace?</h2>
			<p class="center" style="padding-right:10%; padding-left:10%;">The Headspace App is an online guided meditation app filled with simple but beautiful graphics. Its purpose is to make meditation and mental health practices more convenient and accessible. <br><br> The app is free to download, but it has a subscription-based business model with a basic and a premium package. The basic subscription gives users a limited amount of all the features (ie. a few sessions of each feature of meditation course, sleepcast, etc.). The premium subscription is $13 per month (or $70 a year) and unlocks all the features including live meditation (see below). </p>

			<h1>3. Personalized Experience</h1>
			<p>While Headspace offers a collection of diverse Meditation and Sleep features, the app does not fail to create a sense of personalization for the user. The app is designed to highlight the user's personal journey; <span class="blue bold">the app focuses on the user and his or her self-development</span>. Thus, features such as adding buddies and visual representations of progress enhance this feeling of personal achievement, in turn creating motivation for a healthy body and mind.</p>

			<h3 class="center" style="padding-left:15%; padding-right:15%; padding-top:15%;padding-bottom:5%;">After going through all these in-app product features, there are a few specific qualities, some of which have already been mentioned, that I love and other users keep coming back for include.</h3>
			<h1 class="center">First, who are the users and what are there pain points?</h1>
			<section style="padding-left:10%; padding-right:10%;padding-bottom: 10%;">
				<p>Headspace's users include anyone who is busy, subject to a lot of anxiety, going through a life change, etc. <br><br>The first user that comes to mind are <span class="bold blue">students</span>, college students especially. Most college students are living away from home and are learning to independently balance studying, working, socializing, and so much more. They are subject to a lot of pressure and stress, and oftentimes neglect their mental health. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, <span class="bold blue">50% of students rate their mental health below average or poor </span>with 40% of students failing to seek help. <br><br>Another user group would be <span class="bold blue">working parents</span> or even businesspeople in general. With working parents, especially mothers or new parents, balancing work and life becomes incredibly difficult. Lack of sleep is another huge problem with anxious people who are always thinking about their to-do lists. There is little, if any, personal time, and stress is always a constant.<br><br>So, <span class="bold blue">young busy people</span> who are <span class="bold blue">constantly moving</span> and/or stressed are the main target consumers. But, with that being said, Headspace is an app that is applicabl to anyone because mental health and good sleep are important for every single person, regardless of age, gender, race, background.
				An easy and convenient app like Headspace works to promote mental health in a way that they can control and slowly integrate into their lives. <span class="orange">Now, let's discuss what features address these pain points...</span></p>
			</section>
			<section class="flexcenter">
				<img class="img" style="width:80%; padding-right:3%; padding-bottom: 10%;" src="/Freestyle_PM_Challenge/coolheadspace.png">
			</section>
			<section class="flexcol">
				<h3 class="orange">1. Convenience</h3>
				<p style="padding-right:20%;">Because it is a phone app available on both Android and iOS, Headspace is extremely accessible in any location and time at a tap of the finger. Because <span class="bold blue">it is designed for busy people</span>, the app allows the user to decide how long their meditation session should be, ranging from 3 to 10 minutes (see Meditation section above). This feature allows users to complete a session in between meetings, after lunch; it <span class="bold blue">eliminates the inconvenience and time wasted</span> from travelling to a physical meditation studio to relax and meditate. Scheduling and finding time to squeeze in these things will no longer be a stress point either. Headspace makes mental health practices available <span class="bold blue">anytime and anywhere.</span></p>
				<h3 class="right orange">2. End-to-End Visual Experience</h3>
				<p class="right" style="padding-left:20%;">From the moment the user taps onto the app on their phone to during their meditation session to exiting the app, the beautiful graphics create a calming end-to-end experience. Upon opening the app, the <span class="bold blue">muted and soft color scheme</span> (similar to that of this website) create a neutral and calming feeling. There are no bright or clashing colors; everything works and blends together nicely. Additionally, the <span class="bold blue">animations and graphics</span> of various landscapes and creatures are all curved and bubbly, without sharp edges that could subconsciously create feelings of anxiety or stress. Seen throughout the app, the <span class="bold blue">slow, smooth, and fluid transitions</span> in these graphics and animations give users a beautiful and satisfying end-to-end experience. Moreover, there are no cluttered graphics, pop-ups, or ads that disrupt the user's navigation throughout the app. This <span class="bold blue">complete minimalistic aesthetic</span> that <span class="bold blue">enhances the UX</span> is unique to Headspace.</p>
				<h3 class="orange">3. Diversity</h3>
				<p style="padding-right:20%;">The diversity of options and meditation topics, and courses allow users to have a <span class="bold blue">different and interesting experience each time</span> they use the app. According to a Forbes article, 74% of Americans, and millennials in particular, <span class="bold blue">value experiences over material products</span>. So, the broad and diverse options and customizations target these users, encouraging them to return to the app. Moreover, the wide range of topics caters to many interests. Users learn something new and <span class="bold blue">feel productive while relaxing</span> through these different educational courses. This diversity of experiences is something I really love about the app.</p>
				<h3 class="right orange">4. Personalization</h3>
				<p class="right" style="padding-left:20%;">The personalization aspect of the app allows users to <span class="bold blue">feel in control and adapt the app to their daily needs</span>. Users can decide what notifications they receive (ie. reminders to meditate, reminders to sleep, mindfulness tips, etc.) and when they receive it. The customized Siri phrases also allows users to design how they want to use the app. In addition, the clean and minimalistic visualization of the user's journey and stats really show users their progress and <span class="bold blue">makes them feel good</span> about themselves, encouraging to continue to use the app and practice good mental health. (See above personalization features for more details) These personalization features make the app <span class="bold blue">easily integrable into every user's unique lifestyles and habits</span>, adding on to the convenience aspect mentioned earlier.</p>

		<section id="improvements" class="flexcol">
			<h1 class="center" style="color:black; padding-right:20%; padding-left:20%;">Although Headspace is a great app, there are several improvements I would want to implement, categorized into <span class="blue">1. Changing Existing Features</span> and <span class="blue">2. Adding New Features</span>...</h1>
			<h3 class="orange">1. Changing Existing Features</h3>
			<section class="improvementrow">
				<p style="padding-right:5%;"><span class="bold blue">Sleep Tab Transition:</span><br>In the Headspace app, the background theme of the Sleep features are darker than that of the rest of the app. When users use the app in a dimmer setting, the change in colors from light to dark is really abrupt and drastic, which can be a really harsh adjustment to the eyes.<span id="dots1">..</span><span id="more1">Because the app is meant to produce a feeling of relaxation and comfort, the slight agitation in this transition between tabs should be eliminated to improve the overall user experience. Instead, the transition between tabs could be a slight fade in color to help the eyes gradually adjust (similar to how the background color in this website faded into the indigo color for the Sleep section). This change could improve consumer satisfaction and allow users to stay on the app for longer. The metrics to measure the effectiveness of this change could be how many people use the Sleep feature (if this number increases), how long people stay on the app. To test, this change would be rolled out to only a few test users and see if these metrics change or harm the app’s performance/user base.</span>
				<button onclick='myFunction("dots1", "more1", "myBtn1")' class="readmore" id="myBtn1">Read more</button></p>
				<p style="padding-right:5%;"><span class="bold blue">Ordering for Basic Plan:</span><br>For users with the basic plan, some courses, sleepcasts, etc. are locked. However, the available and locked features are all mixed together, creating inconvenience. For example, in the list of sleepcasts, the 3-5 available basic sleepcasts are separated by more than 5 other locked sleepcasts, so users need to scroll multiple times to play an available sleepcast.<span id="dots2">..</span><span id="more2">This ordering makes navigation difficult for basic plan users (see the Sleep section sleepcast video). Instead, the app should order the available courses, sleepcasts, and other features at the top of the list for convenience. This change would improve usability of the app and the customer satisfaction, specifically for basic plan users. Targeting the basic plan users would be really beneficial for the app’s performance since basic plan users make up the majority of the consumer base (more than 600,000 out of 1 million total subscribers).</span><button onclick='myFunction("dots2", "more2", "myBtn2")' class="readmore" id="myBtn2">Read more</button></p>
				<p><span class="bold blue">Star:</span><br>A new feature that allows users to “star” their favorite course, session, sound, sleepcast, etc. would further improve the usability and convenience of the app. The homepage and/or  profile tabs could then also add a section that consolidates the user’s starred and most used courses for easy access.<span id="dots3">..</span><span id="more3"> This change could be supplemented with and designed to model something similar to Spotify’s homepage features which include: recents (“Recently Played”), most-used (“Your heavy rotation”), and ones that users’ have used before but not recently “Jump back in.”</span><button onclick='myFunction("dots3", "more3", "myBtn3")' class="readmore" id="myBtn3">Read more</button>
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="improvementrow">
				<p style="padding-right:5%;"><span class="bold blue">Avatar Customization:</span><br>To improve one of Headspace’s most appealing features, personalization, the user’s avatar should be able to be customized. Right now, the app assigns a random avatar to the user. Instead, the app should allow users to choose between a variety of avatar features such as: head shape, hair shape, color theme, color of shirt, etc.<span id="dots4">..</span><span id="more4"> This personalization aspect would probably even encourage users to user Headspace as more of a community. It allows for users to express their uniqueness as an individual and motivate them to use the buddy feature to build a community/friendships. This way, the user base can expand and the user retention rate can increase as well.</span><button onclick='myFunction("dots4", "more4", "myBtn4")' class="readmore" id="myBtn4">Read more</button>
				</p>
				<p><span class="bold blue">Prizes:</span><br>To continue to improve user retention and motivate users to use Headspace more, the gamification aspect could also be added to. Right now, there are streaks and a visualization of the user’s journey to encourage to consecutive and frequent app usage. To enhance these features, prizes can also be integrated into the app. For example, a prize can be unlocked for a user’s 100th day of using the app. <span id="dots5">..</span><span id="more5">These prizes should be aligned with Headspace’s mission to incorporate mental health and relaxation in people’s lives. A good prize would be a specially designed phone background paper. Since the app’s UI is one of its most notable and well-praised features, the design skills of the graphics team could be leveraged to create pictures that are aesthetically pleasing, motivational, whimsical, relaxing, and functional. By setting these images as their background wallpaper, users will be reminded to set time for Headspace or generally any form of self-care. It is a low-cost way to encourage users to use the app more frequently, while staying true to the mission.</span><button onclick='myFunction("dots5", "more5", "myBtn5")' class="readmore" id="myBtn5">Read more</button>
				</p>
			</section>
			<h3 class="orange">2. Adding New Features</h3>
			<section class="improvementrow">
				<p style="padding-right:5%;"><span class="bold blue">More Senses:
				</span><br>In the long run, Headspace could expand into different fields besides meditation and sleep that also promote relaxation and mental health. Because the meditation courses and sleep features are an auditory experience and the navigation/graphics throughout the app are a visual experience, the app can hone in providing a new experience for the other senses, specifically scent and taste.<span id="dots6">..</span><span id="more6"> The app can integrate a feature with recipes for aromatherapy (scent) and herbal teas (taste). These two features would be more for people who would have more time and use the app in a private setting as opposed to on the go or in the office. By adding these two features, the users would be able to receive a multiple-sense experience from Headspace. This expansion would, of course, have to be decided based off of research and investigations into competitors, the market, internal feasibility, etc.</span><button onclick='myFunction("dots6", "more6", "myBtn6")' class="readmore" id="myBtn6">Read more</button></p>
				<p><span class="bold blue">New Technology:</span><br> The app can also add a feature that uses an Emotion API that detects the user’s emotions and then generates a course/session based on their emotion at that time. Or, users could manually input adjectives that describe how they are feeling and from there, the app would recommend some sessions that would be best for the user.<span id="dots7">..</span><span id="more7">These features would highlight the personalization aspect of the app even more, greatly transforming the app and how it is used. This addition may even be necessary to keep up with the market and other competitors who may use more technology to enhance their offerings. It would be smart to be the first in the market to roll out this feature to gain even more of an advantage over competitors.</span>
				<button onclick='myFunction("dots7", "more7", "myBtn7")' class="readmore" id="myBtn7">Read more</button></p>
			</section>

			<p>To determine the priorities of these feature rollouts, I would like to collect data about what users like, see problems with, etc. from surveys. The performance metrics for each feature would be different for each one, but generally these features target user satisfaction with improvements to convenience, usability/navigation, UX, personalizations, etc. (so looking at our ratings and reviews in the App store/Google Play, if there is an increase in duration of users on the app, frequency of app visits throughout the day, increased usage of the Sleep tab, increased usage of the Buddy feature, user retention rate, etc.)</p>
